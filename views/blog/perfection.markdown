# &quot; Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. &quot; - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

When I'm building a new functionnality, I'm always thinking about this quote from [Antoine de Saint-Exupery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry). What do I really need to achieve my goal ? What else can I remove to get this new functionnality simplier ? Simplicity and clarity lead to good design. Less is more.

So I came up with the idea to redesign Wibeset.com. In fact, I think I redesign Wibeset.com once a year. Anyway, I had the idea to make it fit in a window. I mean no scrolling. The only thing I have really remove is clients because I focus I have decide to focus on homemade projects like [Lygue](http://lygue.com).

<del>Most of the time</del> 100% of the time, I build websites with white background. This time, I going for a darker one and I like it... probably until next year I guess.
